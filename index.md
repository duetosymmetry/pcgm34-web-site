Precision tests of general relativity are being developed
enthusiastically on many fronts, but there is not enough communication
between researchers working across different distance scales --- the
observables, parametrization frameworks, and even alternative theories
are different and hard to compare. The aim of this workshop is to
develop a sort of "lingua franca" for those working on cosmological
and strong-field tests of gravity, the eventual aim being the ability
to usefully interpret observational results across the two fields.
