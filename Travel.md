# Information for flyers

If you will be flying into the area there are several ways to get to
Pasadena.  Depending on where you will be staying may determine which
mode of transportation is best for you. Several options include:

* [Ride sharing services](#rideshare)
* [Fly-Away Bus with Metro Rail](#fly-away)
* [Shuttle Services](#shuttle)
* [Rental Car](#rental)
<!-- * [Taxi or Limousine](#taxi) -->

We highly recommend you read more information about getting to the
Pasadena area and moving around Los Angeles in the
[Caltech Transit Guide](http://caltechbikelab.blogspot.com/p/transit-guide-to-la.html).

<a name="rideshare" />
**Ride sharing services**: Both [Uber](https://www.uber.com/airports/lax/) and
  [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/airports/lax) are now allowed to pick up and
  drop off passenger at LAX. Go to the upper level (departures) at one of the
  designated pick-up points (there's one per terminal). The price for a ride from
  LAX to Caltech is roughly $30, but it depends on surge charges.
  Both services offer carpool options in LA.



<a name="fly-away" />
**Fly-Away Bus with MetroRail**: Go to Ground Transportation Level and
  look for the “Fly-Away Bus” sign along the curb. Take the bus that
  goes to Union Station. Once at Union Station you can buy your bus
  ticket for USD 9 (debit and credit cards only, no cash unless booked
  [online](https://efleet.digital-dispatch.com/bauerslax/) in advance)
  and present it to the driver to retrieve you luggage. Then, enter
  Union Station and take the Metro Gold Line north to Pasadena. You
  will need to buy a TAP card at any of the kiosks there and add
  USD 1.75 value to cover your metro fare to Pasadena. If staying at
  the Vagabond Inn you will want to exit at the Lake Station. If
  staying at the Saga Motor Hotel you will want to exit at the Allen
  Station. Please see the
  [Caltech Transit Guide](http://caltechbikelab.blogspot.com/p/transit-guide-to-la.html)
  for more information and for Metro Rail hours of operation.

<a name="shuttle" />
**Shuttle Services**: If you decide to use a shuttle service then
  there are two commonly used ones:
  [Super Shuttle](http://www.supershuttle.com/) and
  [Prime Time Shuttle](http://www.primetimeshuttle.com/). Please note
  that if you are being dropped off at or leaving from the Caltech
  campus (which is a 20 minute walk or so from the Vagabond Inn and
  Saga Motor Hotel) then clicking the following links will
  automatically add a Caltech discount:

* [Caltech discount code #1](http://www.supershuttle.com/default.aspx?GC=L3F94)
* [Caltech discount code #2](http://www.supershuttle.com/default.aspx?GC=MW26X)

<a name="rental" />
**Rental Car**: You can rent a car from most of the airports in the
  area. We encourage you to look for rates through the company and/or
  travel websites.

The Caltech campus hosts a few [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/)
vehicles on S. Holliston Ave. and San Pasqual St. (on the east side of
campus) that you can rent for the times that you actually need the
vehicle. It is sometimes more cost-effective to use the usual rental
car venues when needing a car for more than half of a day.

<!-- <a name="taxi" />
**Taxi or Limousine**: Hiring a taxi or limousine to go to/from Los
  Angeles International airport (LAX) is not recommended because of
  the long distance and often bad traffic conditions. Prices are much
  more reasonable if going to/from the smaller Burbank airport (BUR)
  by taxi. -->
