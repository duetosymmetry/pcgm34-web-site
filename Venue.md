# Local Restaurants

There are many restaurants located within walking distance of the
Caltech campus. See
[this local area map]({{ site.url }}/images/FOODMapPasadena120810.pdf)
for a list of possibilities.

A few blocks away from campus is Lake Avenue where, going north from
California Blvd, you will find many retail stores and
restaurants. There are some local restaurants here as well as familiar
chains, and some have wait service while others are of the fast-food
variety. Further away still with a long walk or a short car ride is
the Old Town district of Pasadena. There are many restaurants, shops,
and some bars here. Paseo Colorado is an outdoor mall just east of Old
Town that also has some good restaurants, bars, and even a wine
bar. There are also restaurants along Colorado Ave and along Green St
but less concentrated than in Old Town.

There are several places in the area to grab food and drink.  The
Broad Cafe is directly West of the Keck center.  The Chandler Cafe is
a place on campus where you can have your lunch, sit outdoors, and
enjoy a post-meal coffee at the Red Door Cafe in the sunshine.
